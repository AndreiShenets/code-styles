# Code style guide I recommend at the moment

I have been keen on forcing code styles since I started to write code using Delphi language. The reason of it is quite simple - undoubtedly styled code much much more readable and easy to understand. As result I tried to invent some rules which make all developers happy. It is obvious that I failed. My code style was changing while I were writing on Delphi. It also was changing when I had switched to C\# and Javascript. Each language gave me additional issues, examples and style practices.

Looking back at intention to created ideal code style I understand that it is impossible. Especially if you want to invent law-like-rules. But what is achievable is to recommend some style which significantly can improve quality of your code in different aspects. Moreover my recommendations are mostly applicable to any language.

One more time I would like to pay attention that I propose **recommendations** I would possible call them **strong recommendations**. The difference is that recommendation is something that up to you to follow when on opposite side strong recommendations is something that you have to follow but there can be some exclusions in particular case. And of course this guide is not a law.

One more warning. This guide easily can change if I found more useful rules or handy ways to style code.

The first part I would recommend to read is [General principles](/en/general-principles.md). In this part I describe general cross-language principles that I use to style my code. After that you are free to check guides for specific languages.
